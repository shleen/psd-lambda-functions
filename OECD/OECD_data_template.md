## Footnotes

To view the data online:
1. Go to [stats.oecd.org](https://stats.oecd.org/)
2. On the left, click in this order => `Labour` > `Labour Force Statistics` > `Employment by activities and status (ALFS)` > `Employment by activities (ISIC Rev 4)`

### Statistical population (updated as of 27 July 2023)  
The “Employment by activities and status (ALFS)” dataset is a subset of the Annual Labour Force Statistics (ALFS) database which contains annual labour force statistics for the 38 OECD member countries plus Brazil and Russian Federation.

This dataset contains employment and the number of employees, broken down:

- by economic activities (1);by professional status (2):

-employees, employers and own-account workers and unpaid family workers.

Data are presented in number of persons, in percentage or as indices with base year 2015=100. Annual data typically refer to monthly or quarterly averages.

(1) Economic activities are defined according to the Major divisions of the International standard International Classification (ISIC). Data are presented according to the latest revisions of the ISIC: Revision 2 (1968), Revision 3 (1990) and Revision 4 with the exception of the United States for which data is only available in Revision 2 until 2002 only.

There are years for which data are available in both Revision 2 and 3 or in both Revision 3 and 4.

In some cases, the data according to both revisions are updated while only the latest is revised in other cases. This explains why in some cases, the level of employment or the number of employees are different according to the two ISIC revisions. Unless otherwise specified in the country notes data are compiled from the Labour Force Surveys.

(2) The professional status is defined in the International Classification by status in Employment (ICSE-1993). To be considered as an unpaid family worker, the hour-threshold varies from one hour to 18 hours a week.

### Recommended uses and limitations (updated as of 27 July 2023)  
Annual data in this dataset are typically calculated as averages of infra-annual estimates. This can lead to differences with annual data published by National Statistics Institutes.

This dataset contains estimates from the OECD Secretariat for the latest years when countries did not provide data. These estimates are necessary to compile aggregated statistics for the geographical areas for a complete span of time.

Since 2003, employment data by sector for the United States are compiled following the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS); therefore they are not strictly comparable with other countries’ data.

Euro area refer to Euro area with 19 countries. European Union refers to European Union with 27 countries.
